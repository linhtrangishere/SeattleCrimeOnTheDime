We are using data from the Seattle Police Department (SPD) which contains 1.49 million rows and 19 columns. We have identified 13 columns of interest that will help us achieve our goal. Our objective is to create a model that we can hand off to the city to help them predict where a crime would have more likely occurred given the time and type of crime. For example, let’s say someone is a victim of a crime at a certain time and might not know where they are located, the police officers can use our model to best predict where they should intervene and possibly save that person’s life.*"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3796427b","metadata":{"id":"3796427b"},"source":["Imports:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"3e2aa5b4","metadata":{"id":"3e2aa5b4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1764996484783,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":3230,"user":{"displayName":"Gina Philipose","userId":"00803436778980107331"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from sklearn.naive_bayes import CategoricalNB\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report\n","from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n","from imblearn.under_sampling import RandomUnderSampler"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f22589c8","metadata":{"id":"f22589c8"},"source":["Getting the Data (already pre-processed):"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"e1ba64ae","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":498},"id":"e1ba64ae","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1764996502591,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":17806,"user":{"displayName":"Gina Philipose","userId":"00803436778980107331"}},"outputId":"3a5e5b28-7d87-4687-9b40-8e3f15971522"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["  Report Number     Report DateTime   Offense ID        Offense Date  \\\n","0   2010-902213 2010-12-02 16:17:00   7700230809 2010-12-02 14:00:00   \n","1   2011-296913 2011-09-08 17:22:00   7626066385 2011-09-08 00:00:00   \n","2   2015-294854 2015-08-23 20:29:00   7690271814 2015-08-23 13:30:00   \n","3   2014-132453 2014-04-30 13:57:00   7687185106 2014-04-30 13:10:00   \n","4   2019-454354 2019-12-08 15:17:05  12034644268 2019-12-07 20:00:00   \n","\n","         Duration NIBRS Group AB NIBRS Crime Against Category  \\\n","0 0 days 02:17:00              A                     PROPERTY   \n","1 0 days 17:22:00              B                          ANY   \n","2 0 days 06:59:00              A                     PROPERTY   \n","3 0 days 00:47:00              A                     PROPERTY   \n","4 0 days 19:17:05              A                     PROPERTY   \n","\n","  Offense Sub Category Shooting Type Group                  Block Address  \\\n","0        LARCENY-THEFT                <NA>  72XX BLOCK OF WOODLAWN AVE NE   \n","1            ALL OTHER                <NA>      26TH AVE NE / NE 127TH ST   \n","2             BURGLARY                <NA>         9XX BLOCK OF N 72ND ST   \n","3        LARCENY-THEFT                <NA>         14XX BLOCK OF BROADWAY   \n","4  MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT                <NA>       29XX BLOCK OF 19TH AVE S   \n","\n","   ...
